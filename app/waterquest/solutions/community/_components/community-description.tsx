              Providing clean and safe drinking water for communities
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm lg:text-md text-slate-800">
              In many densely populated urban areas, or remote areas, access to
              clean and safe drinking water has been a significant challenge.
              They often face difficulties due to waterborne diseases and other
              water-related health crises. This calls for sustainable and
              long-term solutions to ensure the health and wellbeing of these
              communities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm lg:text-md text-slate-800">
              At Waterquest we can provide great solutions for this use case
              using our range of Lorentz Solar Pumps and accessories. This
              solution can be configured to meet the specific needs of a
              particular community in order to minimize waste of resources.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm lg:text-md text-slate-800">
              One of the solutions we can provide includes a LORENTZ PS2-1800
              C-SJ5-12 solar powered pump which provides 50 mÂ³ (13,200 US gal.)
              of raw water per day, serving almost 1,000 families. To combat an
              contamination of the original water source, the water can be
              chlorinated before delivery. LORENTZ smartTAP Water Dispensers can
              also be integrated into the system as an easy, secure and
              affordable solution for dispensing water.{" "}

              Lorentz Pumps are designed to have a long life, but are also
              designed to be repairable. All the components of a LORENTZ system
              are replaceable down to sub component level quickly and easily. In
              the event of a failure in the system, or as a result of wear and
              tear, the system can be easily repaired without the costs of
              having to replace a whole unit.
