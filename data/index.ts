    title: "Solar-powered Water Pumping for Vineyard Irrigation",
    customer: "Tom Peters, Deere Run Farms",
    location: "Dufur, Oregon, USA",
    size: "12 hectares",
    problem: "The vineyard site is two miles from grid-power. Cost of grid-tied installation estimated at US$ 200,000 plus US$ 1,000 a month service fee and 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Occasional grid-power outages in area are known to last up to a week, sometimes more.Diesel generators are expensive considering rising fuel prices and risk fuel-spill pollution. Alternatives such as windmill pumps impose other challenges.",
    solution: "Solar-powered pumping systems are reliable, cost-effective, high-performance, and low-maintenance. LORENTZ solar pumps have the advantage over competing solar pumps, offering pumping systems for a wide range of applications, with brushless design for improved efficiency, modular design for customized installations, easy set-up, and a reputation for longevity. In many cases this solution offers a comparable or lower cost compared to a grid-power installation, as well as offering energy independence with a low environmental impact.",

    customer: "François Lurton, Hacienda Araucano Vineyard",
    location: "Colchagua Valley, Central Chile",
    size: "30 hectares",
    problem: "With a hot and dry climate and possible variations of the groundwater supply, in order to preserve the high quality of the wine, François Lurton and his team at Hacienda Araucano needed a reliable solution to meet their irrigation needs. Four years ago the comany implemented an “eco responsible policy” which requires an environmentally responsible and long-term sustainable solution.",
    solution: "iEnergia designed, specified and installed a solar powered water pumping system using LORENTZ pumps and solar trackers. The vineyard now has a solution which greatly reduces drought risk, removes reliance on grid power, allows them to irrigate when it is best for the quality of their produce and saves money. All of this is done while reducing their carbon footprint and impact on the environment. The installation supports the “Biodynamic” labels’ stringent standards.",

    title: "Hybrid irrigation in Spain",
    customer: "Apple Farm",
    location: "Zaragoza, Spain",
    size: "18 hectares",
    problem: "The farm has high operating costs of €27,000 per year with the main factors being diesel supply and generator maintenance. The operating costs are endangering the future profitability of the farm altogether.",
    solution: "Replacing the diesel pump with a LORENTZ hybrid solar system significantly lowered the operating costs and automated the irrigation, helping to fund further development of the farm and to secure future profitability.",

    title: "Solar Water Pumping for Irrigation in Oujda, Morocco",
    customer: "Noureddine Lahmidi",
    location: "Ain Sfa, Oujda, Morocco",
    size: "6 hectares",
    problem: "In the village of Ain Sfa 30km from the city of Oujda (Morocco), Noureddine Lahmidi used diesel and subsidized butane to power his irrigation pumps which irrigate 6 ha of olive trees. Increasing energy prices and supply problems meant that an alternative power supply was required. This remote village is not connected to the electrical grid. Diesel and butane prices are increasing due to market prices and subsidy reductions. Fossil fuel deliveries are also subject to supply difficulties resulting in an inability to water crops. The internal combustion engines were also unreliable. These combined difficulties resulted in an increase in the cost of production and therefore a ecrease in competitiveness.",
    solution: "Following a usage and cost analysis it was decided to replace fossil fuel powered pumps with solar powered pumps. The principle of solar water pumping is simple and the techniques and technologies are proven and very reliable.",

    title: "Solar Water Pumping for Center Pivot Irrigation North Africa",
    customer: "AE Photonics Maroc",
    location: "North Africa",
    size: "50 hectares",
    problem: "In a desert in Africa, a large pivot system with a radius of 479 meters is used to irrigate 50 hectares of desert. The fuel costs of operating this system are very high and increasing. The irrigation system is needed to use otherwise dead land for agricultural purpose. Water is being supplied through an artifi cial canal from the Nile. At this point, Alfalfa is grown as feeding hay and harvested eleven times each year with the harvest season exceeding 300 days. Until 2013, a 135 kW diesel generator ran 22 hours per day to power the system.Diesel is priced at USD 0.45. In 2013, the local government temporarily scaled back fuel subsidies resulting in significantly higher prices for petrol, diesel and liquefi ed petroleum gas. Increasing fuel prices, supply diffi culties and uncertainty of future developments meant an alternative power source had to be found in this off-grid area.",
    solution: "Following effi ciency and feasibility analysis, AE Photonics Maroc designed and installed a solar powered system using LORENTZ pumps to replace the diesel powered generator and AC pumps. The pivot speed is automatically controlled proportional to water fl ow. Also, all motors required to move the pivot now are solar powered. In eleven hours the pivot completes one 360 degree turn, providing the required 3,300 m3 of water per day for partial irrigation. At startup, the PV array located at the center of the system can be cleaned by the pivot itself. This not only means no longer relying on fuel and being independent from future reductions in subsidies, but also greatly reduced carbon emissions.",
